                Below you will find some of my projects that have taught me many technical and personal skills. These projects were completed in a University course called &quotIntegrated Cornerstone Design Projects&quot. These projects were all completed in separate groups, with everyone assigned a completely different role. This course did not only expand my skillset in Python and Inventor in a very enjoyable way, but it also allowed me to experience true projects that companies or individuals can actually benefit from. <br><br>
                Asides from these projects below, you are currently viewing another one of my projects; this website. I started around the beginning of October 2021 with zero knowledge of HTML, CSS, or JavaScript and by the middle of November 2021, I was able to develop this portfolio webpage. It may not be perfect, but I am most definitely proud of my work. I gained vast knowledge of HTML and CSS without the assistance of any Frameworks like Bootstrap or Foundation by using many outside resources like Youtube as well as a few books I had around the house. During this project, I also learned a bit about JavaScript, and how useful it is to create responsive items on the webpage. I used JavaScript for the hamburger menu in the top right that has some animations, as well as the collapsable buttons that push down the webage for easier viewing. <br><br>
                I currently am in the process of developing a Discord bot using Python. My goal is to be able to create a bot that joins the voice call and plays music after a user types a command like &quot/play&quot followed by a song name or song link. The process of this development has been delayed due to complications between Youtube and Discord, which creates conflict within the imported Youtube library. Currently, the bot is able to join the voice call on command and also read certain texts typed in chat and reply to them depending on who said it. I hope that the Youtube and Discord complications can be solved soon as I really would like to complete this project.            </p>

                    The purpose of this python code was to control a virtual robotic arm to perform tasks in Quanser Interactive Labs, using a separate server. The code was written and run on a Raspberry Pi 3, and our goal was to pick up and drop off a container into specific location coordinates based on the container&#39s color and size. The arm was programmed to move 4 parts which were the base rotation, base angle, elbow, and fingers with several constraints. The code we created also had to incorporate the use of a color sensor so the arm could determine which container it was. Additionally, the arm had to be controlled within the interface with draggable buttons with certain values. These values correspond to each component of the arm.

                <p> 
                    The purpose of this project was to create a product in Autodesk Inventor that would fit the needs of a client who suffered from lymphoma. We had met with the client a couple of times to discuss design possibilities regarding what she had most difficulty with, and what exactly would be most comfortable for her. With this, we split up as a group to individually create prototypes of our own designs. My thought process included her difficulty of holding a utensil with pressure and comfort, so I put together a rough sketch and created this prototype out of cardboard. The prototype was designed to effortlessly hold a utensil without the need for pressure, and still be accurate and stable.            </div>

            <div class = "cad_draw" >
                <a class = "sketch">
                    <img src = "img/sketch.jpg">
                </a>
            
                <a class = "proto_img">
                    <img src = "img/proto.jpeg"  >

            </div>

            <div class = "sec_desc">
                <p> 
                    We then collaborated, narrowed down, and combined prototypes to finalize the product. Out of the 250+ teams in Engineering assigned with this project, I was able to push our team to success as the project lead to place top 10. Being the project lead taught me how to build more effective relationships, especially when there are individuals who are in need of help. This experience was a huge achievement as not only were we evaluated by faculty, the client herself came through to consider our product.                 </p>
